Em Dash
=======

**WORK IN PROGRESS, DO NOT USE**

A GNOME Shell extension that replaces the built-in dash with a much enhanced version.

It provides the following extra features for the dash:

* Move it out of the overlay and into the **top panel** or to one of the **screen edges**.
* Configure to show windows in **all of the workspaces** (like the built-in dash) or only in the
  **current workspace**.

For the dash icons:  
  
* Configure the dash icon indicator to show **how many** windows are open (the built-in dash only
  shows if *any* are open).
* Configure the behavior of **left-click**, **right-click**, **middle-click**, and **scroll**
  on the dash icons.
* Configure the dash icons to show **window previews** when hovering over them (a Windows feature).
* Configure icons to **"grab"** other windows. This solves a common annoyance with the built-in
  dash, in which poorly designed applications spawn extra icons for their windows. This feature even
  works for WINE applications.

For the drop-down menus:

* Show **quicklists** in the drop-down menu for supported applications (a Unity desktop feature).
* Show **media controls** in the drop-down menu for supported applications (MPRIS).
